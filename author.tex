\subsection*{Mission details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Product}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 	\textbf{Fast and Robust car:}
        
        Plan the works in order to provide a testable car earlier in the year able to guarantee robustness and performances. Continuity, knowledge-transfer and structured organization will provide new tools to respect deadlines.
    
        \item \textbf{Best competitions}
        
        A team with passionate Bachelor students (up to 50$\%$) will provide the required continuity to achieve higher results during the qualifications. If we achieve this, we will create a great brand.
        A great brand is a fundamental step towards the creation of a great team.

        \item \textbf{Innovative solutions}
        
        A solid knowledge transfer and competition successes will give us the knowledge and the resources (both from partners companies and KTH) to achieve more ambitious technological solutions.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Team}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{People first, results driven}
        
        We believe that a clear and structured organization will provide higher outcomes of our efforts. Examples of tools: Job Description, clear personal responsibilities (“Deliver on time, no surprises!”) with well-defined projects (QQTR), organization charts, effective project management and clear performance evaluation.
        
        \item \textbf{Diverse background}
        
        Diverse background means teams composed both Bachelor and Master students from different study areas. This will help with both non-technical solutions, team organization and qualifications.

        \item \textbf{Learning outcome and Friends}
        
        The priority is always to provide the best experience to team members. Both in the learning outcome and in social activities. We want to create a great place to work.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Organization}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Structured and clear}
        
        To create an effective organization training and knowledges are required. This means that all the members and management team (in particular) have to improve their project and group management skills and be aware of how an organization works.
    
        \item \textbf{Knowledge transfer and continuity}
    
        In order to achieve all these goals continuity and knowledge transfer are fundamental. This has to be implemented both through a structured training for the new entries and workshops by former members.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Organization Structure, Roles and Processes}
\label{sec:2}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Management Board}
The management board is responsible for the overall organization operations, decisions and success of the overall team. The management board represents the head and final approver of the whole KTH FS team. The management board is composed by the three team managers and by all the group leaders. The management board has to work towards the realization of the Core Values expressed in the Vision and Mission.

\subsection{Managers}
The managers coordinate the three departments: Driverless, Electrical Vehicle and Operations. They do not take part in the technical development in first person, but discuss and approve the design the overall technical plan with the support of the group leaders.
The managers have important role in project management and communication between the groups both in the same department and in transversal works through different departments.
The managers also has the role of representing the team in front of companies, university, conferences and other events.
They have responsibilities in fund raising and company relationships in collaboration with the Operations department.
Each manager is the first responsible for her/his department operations, organization and success of the department projects.

\subsection{Groups}
Each group defines an area of expertise and usually also an ensemble of related projects that will be handled within the group itself. Members with similar interests, knowledge and responsibilities compose each group. All the groups have a representative member that will be defined as Group Leader and will join the management board. The group leader beside the technical work will have management and communication responsibilities.
The number of members of a group is variable but has to be at least three people and at most seven. Division and merging of groups will be handled accordingly by the department manager and management board. The reasons for this limitations are the following: too large group will hardly have a frequent and effective communication. Moreover, the Group Leader would require to invest too much time for an effective team management.
On the other side, too small group might cause isolation from the rest of the team and consequently lack of communication and knowledge transfer. Moreover, the success of the overall team would be too much dependent to the result of very few members.

\subsection{Group Members}
\subsubsection{Role and Contribute: Job Description}
All the people that successfully pass the recruitment selection process become KTH FS Members.
Members have a clear and exhaustive Job description that specify exactly what are the role, contribution and responsibilities.
Any major changes and customization to role, contribution and responsibilities need to be clearly reported in the job description.
The job description need to be discussed between the member and the group she/he belong to. Moreover the job description need to be approved by relative Department Manager.
The member define with the group what activities, projects and responsibilities he/she want to follow and invest time. Implicitly this also define what activities the member do not need and should not follow. It is crucial for both of the parties (team and member) to have a clear and common view of the role and contribution. For the member that is important in order to have guarantee that all the invested time will be always related with his/her area of interest and expertise, i.e. the reason why he/she joined in the first place.
For the organization a clear role for members is fundamental both for a balanced and control work division and for a fair evaluation performance.
\subsubsection{Time and priorities}
The time and efforts invested in the project is variable, flexible, but consistent during the year. The performance though, will always be related with the quality of results obtained with respect to the result expected (see RACI project in \ref{sec:3}). 
\subsubsection{Member Outcome}
The organization has to provide and guarantee a concrete and effective outcome for all the members.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning outcome: the organization set as first and most important outcome for the member a concrete and effective learning process. This will be delivered with organized knowledge transfer and through the organization resources: equipment, services, sponsors and companies courses and meetings, professors and university collaboration.
    \item Social Cohesion: the organization will always work towards the creation of a positive and inclusive environment that promote the social cohesion and sense of belonging to the group.
\end{itemize}
The two objective should always be compatible and mutual supported.
During the selection process the outcome should be clearly stated to the candidates. At the same time, their understanding and belief in the organization Vision and Mission will be the most important aspect taken into account for the recruitment.


\subsection{Group Leaders}
The responsibilities of the group leader:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Technical}: As all the other members, the primary role of the GL is the technical development. The GL will invest the majority of her/his time accomplishing technical tasks in first person. Moreover, as requisites, the GL has a robust knowledge about the group specific technical area. The GL is perfectly aware of what are the responsibilities and role of the group she/he leads. The GL knows how her/his group is linked with others groups and how the contribution of the group affect the overall project. To achieve this aim, the GL is confident with other technical areas and with the organization structure. As every other member in the team, the GL is involved in first person in projects and technical tasks. The role of GL is not directly related with successful technical achievements, but mostly with personal predisposition.
\item \textbf{Management}: the GL invest a significant part of her/his time to managerial activities. In order to achieve these tasks successfully the GL receive specific training in team and project management. The amount of time required to be invested in management activities is related to many parameters such as the number of members in the group and the role of the group in the team (the time invested in management should roughly belong to 20$\%$ up to 40$\%$).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Focus: Management responsibilities of group leader}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Management Board}: the GL join the Management Board and its activities with periodic meetings and additional activities.
\item \textbf{Group management}: the GL invest time in the group and its members to guarantee the best experience, learning outcome and social cohesion for everybody as expressed in the Core Values. The GL guarantee a fair distribution of the responsibilities and projects allowing everybody to improve and enjoy the activities. Moreover, the GL knows how to handle wisely possible conflicts.
\item \textbf{Project management}: the GL knows how to deliver and handle projects within QQTR (Quality, Quantity, Time and Resources). The GL is confident in project management tools, techniques and best practices.
\end{itemize}
    
\subsection{Manager and Group Leader recruitment}
The selection of GLs and Managers is a decision taken as a result of a constructive discussion in the team through all the involved members. The criteria taken in consideration are: experience and involvement in the team (primary requirement) and personal predisposition to management and transversal activities. In any way the role has to be used as reward for successful technical results or considered as a promotion to an higher level of involvement (since the high involvement has to be shared through all the team members independently to the covered position).

\subsubsection{Group Leader recruitment}
The choice of a new group leader is the result of an open discussion (preferably with no elections) within the group, the former Group Leader and the Department Manager. The final decision then will be briefly discussed and approved by the Management Board.

\subsubsection{Management recruitment}
The selection of the Managers will be primarily handled by the Group Leaders of the relative department, the former Manager and then discussed and approved by the Management Board.
If any of these processes fail to find a new Manager or GL, the responsibility come to the Management Board.

\subsubsection{Timing for management and GLs recruitment}
The choice of the new figures should be done preserving continuity and knowledge transfer during the passage. This can be performed initially trough collaboration between the current GL/manager and the next one, then with mentoring from the former GL/manager to the new one.

\subsection{Duration of the GLs and Management roles}
The normal duration of Managers and GLs could vary from a minimum of 6 months charge and can be renewed once with a maximum of 1 year.

\subsection{Advisors}
Alumni and other experienced profiles that help the organization (both in technical and management fields) would join the Advisors. The Advisors have no decisional or technical responsibilities, they cannot take part of projects with the role of Responsible or Approver, but can be referred as Collaborators and Informee. They are always welcome to join the activities of the team both in the technical and social development. Their presence and constant involvement in the team represent a great added value and resource for the overall team. The involvement of Advisors should be encouraged and supported.

\section{Project Management}
\label{sec:3}

\subsection{How to create project groups}
The projects are handled using the Responsibility Matrix: RACI model (or equivalent). 
In particular, each project need to have:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Responsible} (unique): the member that take the responsibility for the successful completion of the project.
\item \textbf{Approver} (at least one): The ones ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to the Responsible.
\item \textbf{Collaborators}: They support and advise the project responsible. If they have operative tasks they should also have clear responsibilities in the project. The Approver of this sub-project is the Responsible of the original project.
\item \textbf{Informee}: people that has no active role within the project completion, but they need to be constantly informed about the project developments.
\end{enumerate}
Each role need to be properly informed and involved in the project development. Moreover, the overall task division has to be properly documented. You cannot cover more than one role in the same project.
Nested projects are allowed, but a proper documentation and communication need to be implemented.

For other info: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix}{Wikipedia Link -  Responsibility Matrix}


\subsection{How to deliver project}
\subsubsection{QQTR: Quality, Quantity, Time and Resources}
The project has to be delivered with clear QQTR determined through discussion between the Approver and the Responsible (and Collaborators).
Mandatory to specify each single aspect, with particular care to set ambitious, but feasible deadlines (Time). Exactly specify the Resources, such as literature, collaborators, professors, advisors and tools (i.e. competition rules book). Clearly state the expected Qualitative and Quantitative performances as well.
The QQTR has to be properly documented.
(more info in Vision and Mission document and internet https://mikecardus.com/shared-language-of-goal-setting-will-ensure-goals-are-understood/)

\subsubsection{Deliver On Time No Surprises: How to handle deadlines and execution}
The project are handled with “Deliver On Time, No Surprises”. This means that there is no control by the Approver on the daily activity of the Responsible. The Responsible is aware that in case of problems he/she will never receive any judgment (or evaluation) on mistakes or inconveniences. At the same time he/she has the responsibility to inform the Approver as soon as possible of any circumstance that may threaten the designed QQTR. In this case, the Approver and Responsible work together on a new and better solution defining new QQTR.

\begin{svgraybox}
When can the Deliver On Time, No Suprises might fail?
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the QQTR is unclear or not discussed and approved both by Responsible and Approver.
\item If the Responsible is afraid to be judged due to mistake or problems. The Approver then need to create the optimal environment to allow the Projects Responsible to be open about the project developments.
\end{enumerate}
(no links, you can find more info in the Vision and Mission document)
\end{svgraybox}

\subsection{How to define the roles in team projects}
\subsubsection{Projects division}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Vertical Project}: projects completely (or almost completely) handled within the same group. Usually they are part of bigger projects. The Responsible belongs to the group and the Approver is the Group Leader (if not directly involved) or the relative department Manager.
\item \textbf{Transversal Project within same department}: Projects that involve many group belonging to the same department. In this case, the Responsible is chosen within the members of the involved groups and the Approver is the department Manager.
\item \textbf{Transversal Project across departments}: Projects that involve groups in different departments. The Approver is chosen among the Managers of the involved Department.
\item \textbf{Macro Projects}: Projects that involve high number of members involved with extraordinary tasks (such as qualification, testing or event organizations). In this case the Approver is the Management Board.
\item \textbf{Management Projects}: Projects that involve one or more Managers as Responsible. The Approver is the Management Board.
\end{enumerate}
